Homematcher is a home matching application matching home sellers to home buyers. Specifically, Homematcher targets the for sale by owner demographic, giving them a platform to list their homes without the assistance of a real estate agent.

On Homematcher, users create an account and register as either a home owner or a home buyer. They will then fill out a survey based on either what they are looking for in a new home or inputting information about the home they are listing. Then, these surveys are stored in a database and compared to the survey of the opposite user resulting in a matches list of all homes that fit their survey requirements.

This app was built with AngularJS on the front end with CSS bootstrap. On the backend I used NodeJS with express knex, and a postgreSQL database.
